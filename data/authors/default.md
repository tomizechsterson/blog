I write software and solve problems. I learn unrelentingly, and pursue excellence with resilience and passion. Although,
that being said, it would probably be good if I actually _built_ something about which I could write.

I intend for this blog to generally be about my technological foibles and adventures with learning things in the
Linux ecosystem while using non-Microsoft tools. I do enjoy sharing knowledge, and I find myself tinkering with
quite a few different side projects at various times, so hopefully that will give me enough material to post more
often than never. Feel free to click around above.

This page will, at some point, have information about me. Possibly some interests, things I'm currently working on,
and maybe even books I'm reading. Specifically, Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture by Tom Hombergs.
