I've discovered that, for whatever reason, some authors don't seem to have a nice list of books that they've published
with year of publication.[^1] [^2] This post is simply such a list, so I can more easily access this information (and for
some more blogging practice). Hopefully, the walls of text on the wikipedia pages are/were accurate.

[^1]:
    I'm also not a very patient person, so it's very likely I would've found something had I bothered to look for a
    few more seconds...
