Game Jolt seems to be a pretty good place for hosting indie games, with the option to put them up for free (perfect for
learning projects such as these). I'll be hosting these projects there once I start embellishing them, beginning with
[Space Asteroid](/projects/godot-asteroids). The Current Demo link will be updated to point to Game Jolt, and the
initial state will stay here. I figure it might be good to keep a record of where these projects start.
