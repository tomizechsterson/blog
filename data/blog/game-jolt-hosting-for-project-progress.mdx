[Game Jolt](https://gamejolt.com/about) seems to be a pretty good place for hosting indie games, with the option to put them up for free
(perfect for learning projects such as these). I'll be hosting these projects there once I start embellishing them,
beginning with [Space Asteroids](/projects/godot-asteroids). Any other projects that I start modifying will also be hosted there to
begin with from this point on.

Current Demo links will point to Game Jolt, and the initial state will stay here. I figure it'd be good to keep a
record of where these projects start, but let a site that's designed for dev-logging handle documenting ongoing
development, and hosting the executables.

**Update 7/6/25:** Any project that's not graphically-based will be hosted here, since it doesn't make much sense to
deploy something like that on GameJolt. For example, a React project that's been on my mind will be documented here if
I can bring myself to actually work on it.
