So, maybe this is indicative of a problem, but I've done another Godot tutorial that maybe one day I'll get around to
modifying. This was good for reinforcing the "call down, signal up" strategy for communicating between nodes in a
project. I also got to see a couple new concepts: hit/hurt boxes and the AnimationTree for implementing the animations
for running, attacking, and rolling, which was a pretty neat thing to see.
