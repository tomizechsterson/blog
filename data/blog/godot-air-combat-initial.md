This is the result of a [tutorial](https://devga.me/tutorials/godot2d/) that builds a basic schmup.

Click [here](/static/games/air-combat-initial/AirCombat.html) to check out the final result.

This was a shorter tutorial, so the gameplay is pretty basic, and there are some glaring issues. I intend to address
these gradually over time.
