This is the result of a [Godot tutorial](https://www.codingkaiju.com/tutorials/space-asteroid-arcade-shooter/)
that builds a top-down shooter game using an Asteroids-like theme.

Click [here](/static/games/asteroids-initial/space-asteroid.html) if you'd like to see the end result of the tutorial
as written.

Or, if you'd like to see the current state of the project, feel free to click
[here](/blog/godot-asteroids-project-current).

This tutorial taught several techniques, and a good workflow when creating new features. There's some extra assets that
I'd like to make use of, so I'm going to try to do that over time.
