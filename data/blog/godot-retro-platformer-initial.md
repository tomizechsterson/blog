This is the result of a [Godot tutorial](https://www.codingkaiju.com/tutorials/beginner-godot-2d-platformer/) that
builds a side-scrolling retro-looking platformer.

Click [here](/static/games/retro-platformer-initial/RetroPlatformer.html) if you'd like to check it out.

It mostly taught tile-sets and tile-maps, so there's some glaring issues with this one's gameplay. For example, you can
jump off the edges on the left or right, and you will fall indefinitely. Over time, I hope to address these, and maybe
even add some new features as I continue my Godot practice.
