This was a tutorial that went over creating a simple top-down shooter game. I liked how this tutorial included the use
of some A\* pathfinding for the AI and implemented a pause feature.

You can click [here](/projects/godot-topdown-shooter) or navigate through Projects above to check out the demo.
