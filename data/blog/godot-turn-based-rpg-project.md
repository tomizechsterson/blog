Ok, so maybe I have a bit of a problem... However, in my defense, this tutorial was a paid one, and included a handful
of features I hadn't yet worked with. Plus, this was of a new genre, so I had to check it out and get this experience
under my belt. It was very long, but well worth it in the end. I think I learned some great techniques for making this
type of game, and could probably make use of most, if not all, of them in other projects.
