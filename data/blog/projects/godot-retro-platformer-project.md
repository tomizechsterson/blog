This is another Godot project walkthrough that was very helpful in teaching tile-sets, tile-maps, and some basic camera
functionality, among other things. It creates a very basic 2d side-scrolling retro-looking platformer where you can
collect coins.

You can keep tabs on the progress of this project by clicking [here](/projects/godot-retro-platformer) or navigating
via the Projects section above.

This project holds a bit of interest for me, so I expect to address at least a couple of the worst issues, especially
because this was one of the few I got through with minimal trouble, and I had a few ideas for new features at the end.

You've also probably noticed that the dates for these projects seem suspiciously close. This is because I don't remember
exactly when they were completed, and there were long periods of time between some of them. This was exacerbated by the
fact that early on, I would rage-quit a tutorial and write it off as "broken" if I ran into any trouble that I couldn't
immediately figure out. Now that I've been through many (many, many, many, many) more, my abilities in this engine have
increased to the point where fixing these self-inflicted problems is much more within reach. All this to say that the
dates you see associated with them are the dates they were added to the blog, and not when I got to the end of the
tutorial itself.

Just thought you might want to know. And maybe I should write stuff. That's what blogging is, right?
