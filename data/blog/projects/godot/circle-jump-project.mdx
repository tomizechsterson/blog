This tutorial created a game that's actually designed to be run on a mobile device. There is a somewhat embarrassing
visual glitch, but it's technically playable. I appreciated this tutorial exploring the idea of mobile design.

The result of this one was a very basic 'beat your high score' type of game that can be played with a mouse or mobile
device. You can click [here](/projects/godot-circle-jump) or navigate through the Projects link above to check out the demo.

With any luck, I'll get around to at least fixing the rather glaring visual bug during gameplay, but at least it's
technically playable.
