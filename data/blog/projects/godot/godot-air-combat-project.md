I've completed another Godot tutorial that I intend to turn into an experimenting project. This was a shorter one, so
the gameplay is pretty basic, and there were some glaring issues left at the end. I believe trying to address these over time will make for great
progress toward learning this engine. This particular walkthrough builds a basic side-scrolling schmup.

You can find more details on this project through the Projects section above, or simply click
[here](/projects/godot-air-combat).

To be honest, this tutorial has the least pull for me thus far, so I only intend to address a few of the serious
issues. The project page will be updated to reflect its 'finished' state once it gets there, or I lose interest.
