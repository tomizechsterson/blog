summary: Introducing my take on the Godot Space Asteroids tutorial

This was a tutorial to continue my learning in the Godot game engine. At my advanced age, I need way more of these than
I would ever be comfortable admitting in public, and this is one of many, many (many, many, many, many, many) steps on
my journey toward proficiency.

At the end, the result was a basic top-down vertical shooter game. For whatever reason, this project resulted in a good
number of ideas for continued work, so I intend to spend a decent amount of my side-project time tinkering with this
one.

You can find more details on this, and keep tabs on my progress, in the Projects section above. Or simply click
