So, about that Godot project... It seems to be continuing with its momentum, so I'm going to go ahead and embrace that.
It's called Tomato Man, and its [project page](/projects/godot-tomato-man) is up in the Projects section, including a
link to its GameJolt page so you can check it out if you'd like. This will also be a way for me to learn dev-logging
(just like that React project that was so quickly hijacked), so it's not like a total loss in terms of time spent.

Who knows? Maybe this experience will make me better able to blog about that React project if/when I ever get
back around to it. Especially since that project has more significant topics to cover.

Anyway, so here's what we're going to do: Build a Godot project without watching or reading a single tutorial that is a simple,
side-scrolling platformer. This should be a worthwhile effort for the following reasons:

- More practice with Godot which will force me to solve problems in this engine
  - with any luck, this will result in the ability to build larger projects over time
- Try dev-logging and putting something new on this site

---

The blogging will be at a very high level. The plan is to write about:

- What I'm thinking and learning
- The decisions I'm making and why
- A high-level overview of what I'm doing now and plan to do next
- Maybe some words on why this is valuable to me

This won't be:

- A step-by-step tutorial on how to make this game (there's WAY more than enough of those out there)
- A conversation with anyone subjecting themselves to my madness
- Something I intend to make money with (specifically with this project)

Now, before we get started, there will be an article or two with more details about the project itself. I'll also be
sure to set expectations as best I can from the get-go, to try and minimize surprises (why are you subjecting yourself
to this nonsense??).

That should be good for now; see you next time!
