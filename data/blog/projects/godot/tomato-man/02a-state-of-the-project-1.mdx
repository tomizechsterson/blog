So, I guess this is getting kind of serious.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure toHeading={2} />

First of all, I've had about enough of Cypress on this project, so it's ðŸ”¥'d. Here's why: I can test this thing
manually in probably under a minute, and Cypress takes somewhere in the realm of a couple minutes to run, so it's just
not worth the flakiness. For anybody viewing my madness on a phone, I apologize in advance if this site doesn't work
perfectly. I'll try to remember to take a look here and there, but no promises.

Another thing: Whew, that upgrade to NextJS 15 and the new `app` folder structure sure was something (that's a good 12
hours of my life I'll never get back)...

## Current Features

Alright, back to the show. As of right now, the game may be playable, but it's features are as basic and humble as
can be.

#### Basic Maneuverability

- Run
- Jump, double-jump (because double-jump is life)
- Wall slide, wall jump

Currently, the movement isn't super fast and jumps aren't super high, but the level is still navigable. I've been
thinking about bumping those things up and expanding the level, but I'm going to hold off for now. I don't want to get
hung up on that, especially because it would require re-working the level.

#### Basic Gameplay

- pickups: coins, 1-ups, health
- UI that tracks coins, and 1-ups, health

We have a touch of gameplay at the moment. You can run around and pick up the stuff in the level, and the UI will
update appropriately.

## Next Feature

Need to close up the game loop. Currently, all you do is run around and collect all the things, which is nice and
all, but there needs to be some way to end and restart. It'd also be quite nice to have some way to "score" the user.
Current theory is to use a timer and record the user's time and coin count once they get to the end of the level.

This requires some kind of way to end the level. Probably just some differently-colored blocks for now that displays
a message and shows the option to reset or exit when the user gets to them.

This will allow me to set the version to 0.0.1, since I think that once you have a game loop, that should mean you've
officially hit alpha, and that's when you start using (at least some form of) semantic versioning (I'll be using one
that I made up, and I'm ok with that). Specifically, once this project is in alpha, I'll start incrementing the third
third number (0.0.x), and once it's in beta, I'll increment the second number and start using the third one for builds
(0.x.x). Then, once I consider it to be 'production', we'll get to 1.0.0, and _then_ I'll start using semantic
versioning the way it's actually written (major.minor.patch). Why? Because.
