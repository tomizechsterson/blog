I've noticed something during this process of blogging/game dev dabbling: The growth of my Godot expertise doesn't seem to
be moving as fast as it might if I could simply focus on that, and only that. Now, I do know that this whole blogging thing
is, technically, valuable. However, it's not serving my growth in Godot as much as I thought it would. If anything, it's
getting a bit in the way, and needs to step aside so I can increase focus on game dev, which really is my A1 at the moment.

This brings me to the new expectations I'm setting today: The blog will not be forgotten, but the threshold that warrants an
article will increase to now only include things in the "earth-shattering[^1]" category and above. I'll continue to try to
remember to keep notes on things as I go, but it will be more likely targeting more postmortem-type topics. This means
that I absolutely intend to write at least one article when this project comes to a close (again, when it's complete, or
I burn out, whichever comes first), and make use of the things I'll have noted down to that point. Now, as implied, if
something rather significant comes up during the process, I'll try to bring myself to take a moment and write about it.

Also, if burnout starts to set in, and a quick break to write up an article will suffice to get me back on track, I will be
sure to consider that. This could help keep the notes file under control if that starts to get unruly.

In other news, the carrot enemy and player damage are coming along. As of this writing, the enemy is idling and detecting
collisions between it and Tomato Man, and when a collision is detected, the new damage state is working nicely. Just need a
short invulnerability time, and then we can move to player death state, then probably attack. Once these last three bits
are done, I'm thinking that will justify another release to GameJolt, so that'll be good.

So, expect to see less activity on here, but keep in mind that the intention is not to abandon this blog altogether. I do
appreciate the framework and library that I'm using for it, and quite enjoy working with the language its written in (even if
it is infected with typescript). This means that I do have at least some incentive to continue working on this thing, even
if the frequency goes down. Until next time!

    Ok, maybe not TECHNICALLY "earth-shattering", but still, I'm going to save in-project articles for much more
    significant things than simply "progress reports" that happen dogmatically[^2] after every release.

    Which brings me to another point: I tend to be very averse to dogmatism, and I've also started to detect a bit of that
    with this whole blogging thing. So, there's really two main reasons I'm dialing this stuff back a bit to allow more focus on
    Godot dev.
