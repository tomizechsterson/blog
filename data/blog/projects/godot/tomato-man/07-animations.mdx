(I would've put a gif here of Steve Ballmer going "Developers, developers, developers!", but I couldn't find it within a
minute or two, so you'll just have to imagine that while replacing the word "developers" with "animations")

## Current State

Progress has been made since last time. We now have a temporary invulnerability when Tomato Man gets damaged, a death state
(not only for Tomato Man, but also for the carrot enemy and the new mushroom enemy), and the ability to attack the enemies.
There's also been one or two releases to GameJolt since the last article.

Now, of course I couldn't stop there. The game now also has a nice parallax-scrolling background (4 layers), and a lot of
new graphics. You'll notice some new screenshots on the [project page](/projects/godot-tomato-man) showcasing these, plus a
fancy end-level screen, courtesy of Claude Code (who also did the game over screen). The level has even been expanded a bit,
to showcase the new background and slide ability.

As per yuzh[^1], if you're interested in seeing the latest progress, you're always welcome to check it out for free over

## Animations, Animations, Animations

Now, on to the main attraction. So, animations have sort of been a thing for this project, as one can imagine when building
a platformer. The main character has a handful of animations implemented (jump, run, attack, damage, etc.), and there are
still a handful more left to add, mainly all involving the ability to pick up and throw boxes.

Notes:

- State machine taught in most tutorials (that I've seen)
- What happens when you need a state that can apply regardless of current action/state?
  - State Transition works for global state (temp. invulnerability)

    Just discovered an [amusing write-up](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/72678) (at least to me) on this, so I'm going
    to start trying to use this phrase more often on this blog.
