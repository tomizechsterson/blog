Ok, so here's the deal...

As expected, another project came up and immediately took over. For what it's worth, this project will probably be
hosted over on GameJolt, since it's a Godot project, and I would like to try dev-logging that one too. It's also got
some momentum at the moment, which is nice. It'll be added to the Projects section as soon as it gets a couple more
things. Or I'll get back to the React thing... Who knows???
