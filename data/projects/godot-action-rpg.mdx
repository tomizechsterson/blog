This is an action RPG created from this [Godot tutorial][1]. The link above the screenshot will take you to the demo if
you'd like to see the final result.

There are a number of things that could be added here, especially because there's assets that weren't used. Not the
least of which would be a menu system or something.

- Press 'w','a','s','d' or the arrow keys for movement
- Press 'z' or 'k' to roll
- Press 'x' or 'j' to attack
- Press 'Esc' to quit
