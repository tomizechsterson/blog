This is the Air Combat [Godot tutorial][1] page. Feel free to click the links above the screenshots if you'd like to
try a demo. Also, be sure to check back regularly to see new features and bug fixes.

A couple of the big issues I intend to address are the slow handling of the plane (these controls just don't feel crisp
enough for me), and the fact that if you fly too far down (you don't have to go far), the camera will expose the bottom
of the background images, which is not a good look. Over time, hopefully these will get addressed. Also, the tutorial
includes some extra assets that don't end up getting used, so it'd be great practice to find a use for them.
