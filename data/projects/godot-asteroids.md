This is the Space Asteroids [Godot tutorial][1] project page. The links above the screenshots will take you to the
initial version (as it was at the end of the walkthrough), and the current state of the project, as described by the
release notes below. Feel free to check back regularly to see new features and bug fixes.

This tutorial builds a top-down shooter game using an Asteroids-like theme while teaching several techniques, and a
good workflow when creating new features. There's some extra assets that I'd like to make use of, so I'm going to try
to do that over time.
