This is the Space Asteroids Godot tutorial project page. The links above the screen shots will take you to the initial
version (as it was at the end of the walkthrough), and the current state of the project, as described by the release
notes below.

This tutorial taught several techniques, and a good workflow when creating new features. There's some extra assets that
I'd like to make use of, so I'm going to try to do that over time.
