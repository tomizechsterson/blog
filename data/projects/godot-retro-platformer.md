This is the Retro Platformer [Godot tutorial][1] page. The link(s) above the screenshot will take you to the demo(s) if
you'd like to check them out.

This tutorial mostly taught tile-sets and tile-maps, plus some basic camera control, so there's some glaring issues
with this one's gameplay. For example, you can jump off the edges on the left or right, and you will fall indefinitely.
Over time, I hope to address these, and maybe even add some new features as I continue my Godot practice.
