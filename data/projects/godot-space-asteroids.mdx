This is the Space Asteroids [Godot tutorial][1] project page (you may have to use the Wayback Machine). The links above
the screenshots will take you to the initial version (as it was at the end of the walkthrough), and the current state
of the project, hosted on Game Jolt. Feel free to check the project out over there to see new features and bug fixes.

This tutorial builds a vertical shooter game using an Asteroids-like theme while teaching several techniques, and a
good workflow when creating new features. There's some extra assets that I'd like to make use of, so I'm going to try
to do that over time.

- Arrow keys move your ship left and right
- Space bar fires a laser
- Esc exits the game (Current version only)
