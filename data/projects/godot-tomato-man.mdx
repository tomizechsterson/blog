This is a side-scrolling platformer that I'm building to be roughly about the size of a tutorial, but without actually
following a tutorial. It uses some great art assets that I found (link on the [GameJolt page][1]), which didn't look too
complicated for me to utilize. The intent is to continue learning Godot so that hopefully, someday, I'll be able to make
a game of some substance. So, this one won't be sold, but it'll be available for free on GameJolt.

The game will have about 10 minutes of gameplay, but showcase many of the features of a platformer:

- Pickups
- Wall jumping
- Double jump (because double jump is life)
- Enemies \*
- More maneuverability (slide, climb) \*
- Multiple levels \*
- Parallax background (and more graphics generally) \*
- A simple menu with some options \*

\* Not implemented, but hopefully someday
