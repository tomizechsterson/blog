This is a side-scrolling platformer that I'm building to be roughly about the size of a tutorial, but without actually
following a tutorial. It uses some great art assets that I found (link on the [GameJolt page][1]), which didn't look too
complicated for me to utilize. The intent is to continue learning Godot so that hopefully, someday, I'll be able to make
a game of some substance. So, this one won't be sold, but it'll be available for free on GameJolt.

- Arrow keys move left and right
- Space bar jumps
- Esc exits the game

The game will have about 10 minutes of gameplay, but showcase many of the features of a platformer:

- Wall jumping
- Double jump
- Pickups
- Very simple UI prototype that responds when picking up stuff
- Enemies \*
- More maneuverability (slide, climb) \*
- Multiple levels \*
- Parallax background (and more graphics generally) \*
- A simple menu with some options \*

\* Not implemented, but hopefully someday
