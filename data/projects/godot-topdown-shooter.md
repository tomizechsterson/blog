This is the page for the Topdown Shooter [Godot tutorial][1]. The link above the screenshots will take you to the demo
if you'd like to check it out.

This was another good tutorial that made use of tile-sets and tile-maps, but it also taught some decent A\* pathfinding
using Godot. It's not perfect, but it works decently well. There's also a working pause function in this one, which is nice.

There's a bug with reloading the SMG, which is on the list of things to work on with this. There's also a bunch of
console errors when playing in the browser, and the particles had to be removed to make it work there... Not a lot else
jumped to mind by the end, though.

- Press '1' to switch to the Pistol (this is what's selected at the start)
- Press '2' to switch to the SMG
- Press 'r' to reload (only works with the pistol)
- Press 'Esc' to pause
