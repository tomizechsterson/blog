This is the page for the Topdown Shooter [Godot tutorial][1]. The link above the screenshots will take you to the demo if you'd like to check it out.

This was another good tutorial that made use of tile-sets and tile-maps, but it also taught some decent A\* pathfinding using Godot. It's not perfect,
but it works decently well. There's also a working pause function in this one, which is nice. There's a bug with reloading the SMG, which is on the
list of things to work on with this. Not a lot else jumped to mind by the end, though.
