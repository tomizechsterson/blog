This is a turn-based RPG created from an old tutorial I found. The link above the screenshots will take you to the demo
if you'd like to check it out.

The game has about 5 - 7 minutes of gameplay, but showcases pretty much every major system that a game like this would
have, even if they are super basic. This includes:

- Dialog
- Simple quest system
- Inventory
- Screen transitions
- Interacting with objects
- Random, side view battle system
- Basic spell effects
- Sound and music
- Saving/loading

NOTE: Saving/loading doesn't currently appear to work in the browser

The controls are as follows:

Over-world:

- Press arrow keys to move
- Press 'Enter' or 'Space' to interact with objects
- Press 'Esc' to open up the menu

Menu/Battle:

- Press arrow keys to select an option
- Press 'Enter' or 'Space' to confirm selection
- Press 'Esc' to close the menu (Or select the Close option)
  - If in battle, this will not exit. You must select the Run command to exit battle early.
